### Pigsy, comrade of Sun Wukong

Since our data toolkit is called Wukong, after the fearless monkey warrior in the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, there was only one natural name for our library of Pig UDFs. 

Pigsy (Zhu Bajie) is one of the three helpers of Sun Wukong. His Buddhist name "Zhu Wuneng", given by Bodhisattva Guanyin, means "pig (reincarnated) who is aware of ability," or "pig who rises to power".
